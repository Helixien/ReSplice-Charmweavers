	<name>ReSplice: Charmweavers</name>
	<author>Helixien</author>
	<description>ReSplice is the banner under which I will release any xenotype I feel like making. Similar to ReGrowth, I aim for my additions to be vanilla friendly in both artstyle and lore. Everything added was made to fit or mirror vanilla. From a simple UI texture to a new more complex system,being as performance and vanilla friendly is the main objective I have.

Inspired by the well known Succubus (and Incubus), Charmweavers are a new archite powered xenotype you can encounter and add to your colonies. They are rare, similar to sanguophages, and quite unique, offering some interesting upsides and downsides.

Charmweavers are a relatively simple xenotype. They should work fine in whatever load order you have and be a nice addition, if not for the xenotype itself, then for the genes they add.

ReSplice is designed to be as lightweight as possible, adding the minimum of new code required for its additions to work.</description>
